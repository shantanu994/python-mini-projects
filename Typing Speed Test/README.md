## Typing Speed Test 
- A Python command-line application that measures your typing speed (WPM) and accuracy. The program displays a random sentence for you to type, calculates your speed, and records your score in a text file.

# Features:

- Typing Speed Calculation – Measures your words per minute (WPM).
- Accuracy Check – Restarts if your typed sentence has mistakes.
- Score Recording – Saves your name and typing speed in a file.

# How it Works:
# The app displays a random sentence for you to type.

- It starts a timer when you begin typing and stops it when you're done.

- If you type the sentence incorrectly, it asks you to retry.

- Once completed, it calculates your Words Per Minute (WPM) and saves your score in typing_scores.txt.

# Why I Built This:
# This project helped me practice:
- Python basics (functions, loops, conditionals)
- File handling (saving user scores)
- Randomization and timing
